About Filebox-Client
--------------------
This is a small Qt application that watches over a directory and uploads new files from it automatically to your [Filebox](https://shirakumo.org/project/filebox) account. When a new file is detected, it uploads it, deletes it from the folder and puts the link to the uploaded file into your clipboard.

To run it, simply use `filebox-client:main`.
